## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

Return to [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

Return to [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Return to [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

Return to [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

Return to [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### PreferredContact feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allow users to add/edit the preferred contact method of the client
using their index relative to the current list shown in InsuraHub

There is only 2 preferred contact methods

1. phone number
2. email

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the PreferredContact mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to add a preferred contact method for a client, `Alex Yeoh`, who is already stored in the application.
2. The user tries to add a preferred contact method using `preferredContact 1`.
3. InsuraHub displays a error message stating `"At least one field must be provided"`.
4. The user then tries to add a preferred contact method using `preferredContact 1 pc/phone`.
5. `PreferredContactCommandParser` and `AddressBookParser` will check if the command format provided is valid before `PreferredContactCommand#execute()` is called.
6. InsuraHub will check if the client exists in the `UniquePersonList`.
7. If the client exist, the preferred contact method of the client will be updated.
8. The result of the execution of the command will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object.
9. This object will then be passed to `Logic`.
10. The execution will then be over as the preferred contact method will be highlighted and the adding preferred contact command successful message will then be displayed.

The following activity diagram shows how the Preferred Contact operation works:
<img src="diagrams/PreferredContactActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the Preferred Contact operation works:
<img src="diagrams/PreferredContactSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### AddTag feature

#### Current Implementation

The AddTag feature allows users to add tags under a certain client by indexing the client.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AddTag mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to delete a tag for `Alex Yeoh` who is the first client listed in InsuraHub
2. The user wants to add the tag `friend` to the client `Alex Yeoh` by entering the command `addTag 1 t/friend`
3. The `execute` method of the command will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object
4. This calls the `createPersonWithAddedTag` method which creates a new client with the same details as `Alex Yeoh` but with the newly added tag
5. The `model` calls the `setPerson` method and updates the targetted client with the newly created client from the previous step
6. The `CommandResult` is then returned by the `execute` method and the UI will display the updated list of clients with `Alex Yeoh` having the newly added tag and a success message is displayed on the UI

The following activity diagram shows how the AddTag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/AddTagActivityDiagram.png" width="450">

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddTag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="450">


### DeleteTag feature

#### Current Implementation

The DeleteTag feature allows users to delete tags under a certain client by indexing the client.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the DeleteTag mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to delete a tag for `Alex Yeoh` who is the first person in the InsuraHub
2. The user tries to delete tag with command `DeleteTag 1 t/friends`
3. InsuraHub displays an error message `Tags provided do not exist. Please provide an existing tag.`
4. Realising that the tag he wants to delete is `friend`, the user tries to type `DeleteTag 1 t/friend` instead
5. The result of the execution of the command will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object
6. This will then be passed to `Logic`
7. Upon confirmation that the tag exist in the first client of the address book, in this case `Alex Yeoh`, the tag is deleted from the UI of `Alex Yeoh` client
8. A successful message is returned, in this case `Deleted tags successfully for person Alex Yeoh; Phone: 87438807; Email: alexyeoh@example.com; Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40; Tags: `

The following activity diagram shows how the DeleteTag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/DeleteTagActivityDiagram.png" width="450">

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteTag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/DeleteTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="450">

### Filtering by Tag feature

#### Implementation

The proposed tag filtering mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommandParser`, `FilterCommand`, and `FilterTagPredicate`.
The `FilterContainsKeywordsPredicate` implements the `Predicate<Person>`class which implements the test operation:

- `test(Person)` - Checks through the `Set<Tag>` of the Person passed to the method for the target tag being filtered.

The `FilterCommandParser` created by the `AddressBookParser` parses any `filter` command to create
a `FilterCommand` object which calls its `execute` method and the `updateFilteredPersonsList` method of the Model is
called with the `FilterContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as its parameter.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application. The current `filteredPersonList` is simply a list of all Person objects
   in the `AddressBook`.

2. The user executes `filter t/Friend` command to filter for all Person objects in the address book
   with the tag `Friend'`. The `filter` command calls the `ParseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` which
   returns a `FilterCommandParser` object.

3. The `FilterCommandParser` object then calls its `parse` method, returning a `FilterCommand` object
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`, calling the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of the `Model`.

4. The update list of filtered `Person` objects are then displayed on the ui.

The following activity diagram shows how the filter tag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/FilterTagActivityDiagram.png" width="450">

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter tag operation works:
<img src="diagrams/FilterTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### File feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allow users to open a folder unique to each client to store their files
using their index relative to the current list shown in InsuraHub

these folders are stored in a main folder called ClientFiles in the main directory of InsuraHub

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the file mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to file certain documents for a client, `Alex Yeoh`, who is already stored in the application shown as the first person on InsuraHub.
2. The user tries to open a folder for the client with command `file 1`
3. InsuraHub will fetch the 1st client currently shown, if the index 1 is not out of bound in the list.
4. If the index is valid, the `Name` of the client and the `hashCode` will be concatenated to get a unique folder name for the client.
5. If the folder with the unique folder name does not exist then the folder will be created and placed in the ClientFiles folder.
6. The folder in the ClientFiles folder with the unique folder name will be opened.
7. The execution will then be over as the user can now drop files for the client into this opened folder, file command successful message will be displayed.

Activity diagram for file Command:
<puml src="diagrams/FileActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />


### GroupMeeting feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allow users to filter based on the client preferred meeting region

There are only 5 preferred meeting regions:

1. north
2. south
3. east
4. west
5. central

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Group Meeting mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to group all clients who prefer to meet in the west as he/she is planning to meet clients who live in the west.
2. The user tries to filter clients using `groupmeeting`.
3. InsuraHub displays a error message stating `"At least one region must be included"`.
4. The user then tries to filter clients using `groupmeeting west`.
5. `GroupMeetingCommandParser` and `AddressBookParser` will check if the command format provided is valid before `GroupMeetingCommand#execute()` is called.
6. InsuraHub will check if users in the list fulfills the `GroupMeetingContainsKeywordPredicate`
7. The result of the execution of the command will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object.
8. This object will then be passed to `Logic`.
9. The execution will then be over as the updated list of filtered `Person` objects are displayed on the Ui

<img src="diagrams/GroupMeetingSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Add Policy feature

#### Current implementation

InsuraHub allows users to add insurance policies to keep track of new policies that clients have purchased through them

There are 5 attributes for each policy:

1. Policy Name (pn)
2. Policy Description (pd)
3. Policy Value (pv)
4. Policy Start Date (psd)
5. Policy End Date (ped)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Add Policy Mechanism works:

1. The user launches the application and wants to add a policy for `Alex Yeoh` who is the first client listed in InsuraHub
2. The user wants to add a policy with `policyName: Health Insurance`, `policyDescription: Cancer Plan`, `policyValue: 2000.00`, `policyStartDate: 2023-01-01`, `policyEndDate: 2024-12-12`
3. The user enters the command `addPolicy 1 pn/Health Insurance pd/Cancer Plan pv/2000.00 psd/2023-01-01 ped/2024-12-12`
4. The `execute` method of the `AddPolicyCommand` will be called
5. This calls the `createPersonWithAddedPolicy` method, creating a new Person object with the same details as `Alex Yeoh` but with the newly added policy
6. The `model` calls the `setPerson` method and updates the targetted client with the newly created client from the previous step
7. The `CommanResult` is then returned by the `execute` method and the UI will display the updated list of clients with `Alex Yeoh` having the newly added policy and a success message is displayed on the UI
   
The following activity diagram shows how the AddPolicy operation works:
<img src="diagrams/AddPolicyActivityDiagram.png" width = "450">

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddPolicy operation works:
<img src="diagrams/AddPolicySequenceDiagram.png" width = "450">

### Remove Policy feature

#### Current Implementation

The Remove Policy feature allows users to remove policies under a certain client by indexing the client and indexing the policy to be deleted

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Remove Policy mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to remove a policy from `Alex Yeoh` who is the first client listed in the InsuraHub UI
2. The user wants to remove the first (right-most) policy of `Alex Yeoh` with command `removePolicy 1 1`
3. The `execute` method of the `RemovePolicyCommand` object will be called
4. That will then call the `removePolicy` method on the existing Person object identified by the indexes
5. The model will then call the `setPerson` method and updates the targetted client with the policy removed from the previous step
6. The `CommandResult` is then returned by the `execute` method and the UI will display the updated list of clients with `Alex Yeoh` not having the policy that was removed and a success message is displayed on the UI

The following activity diagram shows how the RemovePolicy operation works:
<img src="diagrams/RemovePolicyActivityDiagram.png" width = "450">

The following sequence diagram shows how the RemovePolicy operation works:
<img src="diagrams/RemovePolicySequenceDiagram.png" width = "450">
### View Policy Feature

#### Current Implementation

The View Policy feature allows users to view the details of policies under a certain client by indexing the client and the policy

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the View Policy mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to view the policies of `Alex Yeoh` who is the first client listed in the InsuraHub UI
2. The user wants to view the first (right-most) policy of the client `Alex Yeoh` by entering the command `viewPolicy 1 1`
3. The `execute` method of the `ViewPolicyCommand` will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object
4. This converts the `policyList` from a `Set` to a `List` and uses a `stream` to index the target policy to be removed
5. The `CommandResult` is then returned by the `execute` method with the `toString()` of the `policy` indexed from the previous step
6. The UI will display the details of the policy specified by the index and a success message is displayed on the UI

The following activity diagram for viewing policy of a particular Client:
<img src="diagrams/ViewPolicyActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the View Policy operation works:
<img src="diagrams/ViewPolicySequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Filter Policy Description feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allow users to filter clients based on their policy details, currently only filtering policy description

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Filter Policy mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application and wants to filter clients who have Cancer Plans
2. The user tries to filter clients using `filterpolicydescription`.
3. InsuraHub displays a error message stating `"Invalid Command format"` with examples of how to use the command.
4. The user then tries to filter clients using `filterpolicydescription Cancer Plan`.
5. `FilterPolicyDescriptionCommandParser` and `AddressBookParser` will check if the command format provided is valid before `FilterPolicyDescriptionCommand#execute()` is called.
6. InsuraHub will check if users in the list fulfills the `FilterPolicyDescriptionPredicate`
7. The result of the execution of the command will then be used to create a `CommandResult` object.
8. This object will then be passed to `Logic`.
9. The execution will then be over as the updated list of filtered `Person` objects are displayed on the Ui

The following activity diagram shows how the Filter Policy Description operation works:
<img src="diagrams/FilterPolicyActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Toggle Mode feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allows users to toggle between a dark(default) or light mode to their preference to maximise their productivity

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Toggle Mode mechanism behaves at each step

1. The user launches the application in the default dark mode and wants to toggle it to light mode and enters the command `toggleMode`
2. The `execute` method of the `ToggleModeCommand` is called
3. The `uiModeManager` calls its `getUiMode` method and stores the current `uiMode` in a string
4. The `uiMode` is detected to be the default value of `MainWindow.fxml` and is updated to `LightWindow.fxml`
5. The `CommandResult` is returned by the `execute` method and the mode of the UI will be switched to Light Mode on the user's next start up of the application
6. The UI will continue displaying the list of clients and a success message is displayed on the UI

The following sequence diagram shows how the Toggle Mode operation works:

### Change Password feature

#### Current Implementation

InsuraHub allows users to change the required password to enter InsuraHub

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the changePassword command behaves

1. The user launches the application and sets the password as "oldPW1" before entering InsuraHub with the password.
2. The user wants to change the password and enters the commant `changePassword op/oldPW1 np/newPW2`
3. The `passwordManager` calls its `check` method on the old password given "oldPW1" to determine if the current password saved in encoded.txt in the data folder is indeed "oldPW1"
3. The `passwordManager` detects that the old password is indeed correct and calls its `set` method to set the new password as "newPW2" by modifying the string saved in encoded.txt in the data folder.
5. The UI will continue displaying the list of clients and a success message is displayed on the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/changePasswordActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the changePassword operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/changePasswordSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- has a need to manage a significant number of client's contacts
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
- has a need to be able to easily find different clients contacts
- remembers some of their client's only by their firstname,lastname,nickname or initials
- needs to handle a large amount of documents that are stored for different clients

**Value proposition**: manage client's contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app while providing ways to efficiently find/store specific client and their documents

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Add Feature - Email Validation

#### Current State

The `email` parameter for adding a new client to InsuraHub currently only allows alphanumeric characters in the local-part for email addresses in the format local-part@domain.com

#### Planned Enhancement

The local-part will allow special characters which are commonly used in email addresses with the limitation of having no consecutive special characters together

### Add Feature - Phone Number Validation

#### Current State

The `phone number` parameter for adding a new client to InsuraHub currently does not check for if the phone number is a typical valid Singaporean phone number that begins with 6, 8, or 9

#### Planned Enhancement

The `phone number` will be checked to ensure it starts with 6, 8, or 9, with an error message thrown if it fails that check

### Add Policy Feature - Invalid parameter and prefix name

#### Current State

No errors for Invalid prefixes:

- Having 2 `pn` prefixes (policy name) does not return the user any error in the InsuraHub UI
- No error message on the UI for empty parameters such as an empty policy name `pn`
- The `policy description` should be of the prefix `pd` in the `addPolicy` command but using an unknown `pr` prefix that precedes the policy description does not throw any error
  Invalid dates such as `2023-02-29` do not currently return errors in the UI

##### Planned Enhancement

- The prefixes will be checked to ensure that the `addPolicy` command entered by the user is a valid command with the correct prefixes
- The `policy start date` and `policy end date` will be checked to ensure that they are valid dates, including edge cases such as leap years

### Add Policy Feature - Special characters allowed

#### Current State

The Add Policy command currently allows for special characters such as `;;` which is not how policies would be named

#### Planned Enhancement

Policy name and description will be checked through for special characters and corresponding error messages will be returned in the UI

### Remove Policy Feature - Success message incorrectly formatted

#### Current State

The success message is currently not formatted properly with the details of the client wrapped in braces preceded by `seedu.address.modelâ€¦â€‹.`

#### Planned Enhancement

The success message will be formatted properly

### Preferred Contact Feature - Parameters must be lowercase

#### Current state

The Preferred Contact command only accepts parameters in lower-case but there is no warning when the user enters a parameter in uppercase

#### Planned Enhancement

There will be error message returned in the UI when the user enters the parameters not in lowercase (either `email` or `phone`)
